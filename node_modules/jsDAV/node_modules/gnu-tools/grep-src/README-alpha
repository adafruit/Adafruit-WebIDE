The development source code is available via Git from Savannah: see
<http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grep.git>.  The main project page is at
<http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/grep/>.

The source code in the Git uses autotools to generate some files. Before
following the instructions in the INSTALL file for compiling grep, you
need to run the bootstrap script. If you don't have the autotools
installed on your system, see README-boot.

Test releases are available at <http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grep/>.

Please submit bug reports to <bug-grep@gnu.org>.

To follow development more closely, there is also the grep-commit mailing

modified file) from CVS are automatically sent.  To subscribe, send an
